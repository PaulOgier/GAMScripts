## üìö Scripts Library

Here is a breakdown of the available scripts. Each script is designed to solve a specific problem.

### **1. Split Calendar CSV Events \ CSV File Splitter (`split_by_size.py`)**

* **Description**: Splits a single, massive CSV file into smaller, more manageable chunks based on a specified file size (e.g., 5 MB).
* **Best For**: Processing huge GAM reports that are too large to open in Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.
* **Usage**:
    ```bash
    python3 split_by_size.py <input_file.csv> [max_size_in_mb]
    ```
    * `<input_file.csv>`: The path to the large CSV you want to split.
    * `[max_size_in_mb]`: (Optional) The maximum file size for each chunk. Defaults to 5.

<br>

### **2. Split Calendar CSV Events \ User Event Exporter (`filter_and_split.py`)**

* **Description**: Filters a master CSV of calendar events for multiple users and creates a separate CSV file for each user containing only their events from a recent period.
* **Best For**: Auditing recent user activity or creating individual calendar reports for compliance or archival purposes.
* **Usage**:
    ```bash
    python3 filter_and_split.py <input_file.csv> <days_ago>
    ```
    * `<input_file.csv>`: The master CSV containing events for all users.
    * `<days_ago>`: The number of days back from today to include events for (e.g., `30`).

<br>

### **3. Split Calendar CSV Events \ Single User CSV Creator (`split_csv.py`)**

* **Description**: Takes a CSV file with multiple users and creates a new, individual CSV file for each user listed.
* **Best For**: Creating individual data files for mail merges, or preparing data for other scripts that need to run on a per-user basis.
* **Usage**:
    ```bash
    python3 split_csv.py <input_file.csv>
    ```
    * `<input_file.csv>`: The CSV file containing a 'primaryEmail' column.
