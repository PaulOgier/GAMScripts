Author:       Paul Ogier
Created:      2023-06-22
Updated:      2026-09-02
Version:      5.7.0
Status:       Production
Python:       3.8+
Dependencies: GAM ADV X (GAM7), GYB (optional), rclone (optional)

Verified against GAM7 wiki as of May 2026.
Safe-by-default (DRY RUN), summary-driven, production-friendly.

Features:
- Cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux) using Python subprocess
- Robust CSV parsing for GAM outputs (no shell pipelines)
- Clear CLI flags for all operations
- Pre-flight snapshot of user state before changes (audit trail)
- Email backup and migration via GYB with Migrated/<user> labelling
- Drive transfer with organised folder creation
- Drive backup via rclone (optional)
- Shared Drive DETECTION: reports drives the leaver organizes and flags any
  left with no other organizer (content is owned by the drive, not the user,
  so nothing here transfers or backs it up — it must be handled by hand)
- Device wipe and ChromeOS deprovisioning
- Vacation responder, email forwarding, mailbox delegation cleanup
- Calendar transfer / ACL wipe and signature backup
- Already-suspended user detection with optional --unsuspend
- Coloured terminal output
- Startup version check against remote VERSION file (toggleable)

Prerequisites:
- GAM ADV X (GAM7) installed and in PATH (or full path set in CONFIGURATION)
- (Optional) GYB installed for email migration
- (Optional) rclone configured with a Google Drive remote for Drive backup

IMPORTANCE LEGEND:
  [CRITICAL]    - Must execute for security; failure needs immediate attention
  [IMPORTANT]   - Strongly recommended; skip only with good reason
  [RECOMMENDED] - Best practice; safe to skip in some scenarios
  [OPTIONAL]    - Nice to have; purely convenience

Execution order rationale:
  1.  Pre-flight snapshot  - Capture state BEFORE any changes (audit trail)
  2.  Kill switch          - Containment first (OU move, deprovision, password)
  3.  Device management    - Remove mobile/ChromeOS access
  4.  Group removal        - Revoke group-based permissions
  5.  Delegate cleanup     - Remove inbound AND outbound delegates
  6.  Local backups        - Drive (rclone) and mailbox (GYB) archives, if asked for
  7.  Data transfers       - Drive, email, aliases, calendar (licence must still be active)
  8.  Shared Drive check   - Report drives the leaver organizes alone (nothing moves them)
  9.  Email forwarding     - Set up forwarding to successor
  10. Auto-reply           - Inform senders (only useful pre-suspension)
  11. Licence removal      - Free up seats (after transfers; before suspension)
  12. Suspension           - LAST, because many operations fail on suspended users

Default mode: DRY RUN (no changes made). Execution requires explicit --doit flag.

Example usage:
  python offboard_user.py                                          # Dry run
  python offboard_user.py --doit                                   # Execute
  python offboard_user.py --doit --backup-drive --backup-email     # Backup locally
  python offboard_user.py --doit --no-transfer --backup-drive      # Backup, no transfers
  python offboard_user.py --doit --force --user leaver@yourdomain.com \
      --all-transfer-to testoffboard.team@yourdomain.com                              # Non-interactive, one destination
  python offboard_user.py --doit --force --user leaver@yourdomain.com \
      --all-transfer-to testoffboard.team@yourdomain.com \
      --drive-to testoffboard.manager@yourdomain.com                                  # Split: Drive -> manager, rest -> team
  python offboard_user.py --doit --force --scorched-earth          # DELETE user
  python offboard_user.py --help

Transfer destination precedence (Drive, Email, Alias, Calendar, Forward):
  1. Phase-specific flag (--drive-to, --email-to, --alias-to,
     --calendar-to, --forward-to) -- highest priority
  2. --all-transfer-to (fallback default for any unspecified phase)
  3. Interactive prompt (only when --force is NOT set)

  Under --force, every non-skipped transfer phase MUST resolve to a
  destination via (1) or (2), or the run aborts before any change is
  made. Use --no-drive / --no-email / --no-alias / --no-calendar /
  --no-forward to opt phases out of the requirement.

Cross-platform notes:
- Windows: Colours auto-disabled on legacy CMD; works in Windows Terminal
- macOS/Linux: Full colour support in any modern terminal
- Path handling uses pathlib for OS-agnostic paths
- Subprocess calls use shell=False with list args for safety
- Pipe commands use platform-aware shell detection

  2026-05-13 - v4.5.0 - BREAKING: renamed --transfer-to to --all-transfer-to. Added per-phase destination flags (--drive-to, --email-to, --alias-to, --calendar-to, --forward-to) that override the global default; precedence is phase-specific > --all-transfer-to > interactive prompt. Added upfront destination resolution and validation before any phase runs: under --force, any non-skipped phase without a resolvable destination aborts the run with a clear error instead of half-offboarding.
  2026-05-14 - v4.6.0 - Added end-of-run MANUAL ACTION block surfacing admin-console instructions for durable mail capture (alias / recipient address map / group) since GAM cannot configure recipient address map and Gmail-level forwarding stops on suspension/deletion; new --forward-alias-to flag explicitly nominates the successor printed in the block (falls back to --forward-to then --all-transfer-to), no automated change is made. Guide gains a "Mail capture after suspension" section and the order-of-operations list flags forwarding's suspension limitation.
  2026-09-02 - v5.7.0 - Top-to-bottom audit round (docs/2026-09-02-audit-offboard-user.md).
                        CTRL+C SAFETY: every gam call refused to run once Ctrl+C had
                        set the shutdown flag, so the atexit re-suspend guard could
                        never re-suspend (it slept 90s and printed EMERGENCY with the
                        account still active), and a Ctrl+C between kill-switch steps
                        left the user moved to the unenforced OU with their password
                        intact and sessions alive, then exited before the forced
                        suspension. The kill switch, the containment-failure suspend
                        and the guard now run to completion regardless (bypass_shutdown);
                        the restore retry loop and the read-back polls stop promptly
                        instead. HONEST SUMMARY: "Re-suspended (restored original
                        state)" was recorded whether or not the re-suspend verified;
                        a failed `print groups` or device query was reported as "no
                        groups"/"no devices" and the removal skipped; a short GYB
                        backup was restored anyway and reported "Email migrated". All
                        three are now errors, and the migration line carries GYB's
                        resume-DB count against the files on disk. FLAG CONFLICTS are
                        usage errors instead of silent overrides: --scorched-earth with
                        a backup, transfer, --unsuspend or --no-suspend flag;
                        --reuse-email-backup without --email-to or with --no-email;
                        --restore-batch-size 1. Scorched earth keeps the pre-flight
                        snapshot (read-only, the last record of the account). The
                        skipped-messages CSV is always appended (a retry's re-scan
                        truncated the rows the crash-directed pass had written).
                        SPEED: licences are read from the `Licenses:` block that the
                        snapshot's `gam info user` already returns (the separate
                        `print licenses` listed every licence in the tenant, 23s on a
                        50-user tenant); the snapshot's six reads, the two device
                        queries and the three dependency probes run in parallel; the
                        four transfer phases no longer re-validate a destination the
                        preflight already checked; the Drive trash count queries
                        `trashed = true` instead of listing the whole Drive twice.
                        Pre-flight snapshot 40s -> 8s; a full live offboarding of a
                        small account 3m38s on Linux, 3m04s on Windows. STRUCTURE: one
                        streaming reader for GYB, rclone and the Drive transfer; one
                        parser for `info user quick`; one backup-folder picker; one
                        skipped-messages recorder; the restore loop's decision is a
                        pure function; main() is split into main() and
                        run_offboarding() with a phase runner, and an integration
                        suite (test_offboard_main.py) now drives it end to end. Signal
                        handlers and colour detection moved out of import time. Phase
                        headers are un-numbered. Dead: the Python 3.7 check, the
                        stderr-stripping in remove_groups, the inert base non-fatal
                        patterns, the PyYAML mention. Test fixtures are captured GAM
                        7.48.01 output (fixtures/), and the unit suite no longer
                        reaches a real gam binary (two tests did).
  2026-08-31 - v5.6.1 - Scorched earth now refuses when a Shared Drive's membership
                        could not be read, not only when the leaver is its confirmed
                        sole organizer (the other half of issue #9). An unread ACL is
                        reported as unknown, and unknown no longer counts as permission
                        to delete.
  2026-08-31 - v5.6.0 - Closes issues #11 and #9. A Drive backup short by real files
                        now fails the run and holds licence removal; Forms and Sites,
                        which cannot be exported, are an accepted gap. Scorched earth
                        is gated on the Shared Drive check, which runs before the kill
                        switch; --allow-orphaned-shared-drives overrides. Suspension
                        verification waits up to 120s (measured 54s after the kill
                        switch's burst of writes). `print shareddrives` exit 60 on an
                        empty result is no longer a failed read. The migration label
                        is reported as `_Migrated/<user>`, the name GYB creates.
  2026-08-05 - v5.5.0 - Full-script audit round: five silent-swallow fixes and three
                        preflight/runtime improvements.
                        INTERACTIVE DESTINATION GUARDS: destinations typed at the plan
                        prompts now get the same checks as flag-supplied ones — the
                        leaver's own address or alias is refused (self-restore /
                        mail loop), and an email destination without a usable Gmail
                        mailbox is refused BEFORE the multi-hour download.
                        BACKUP VERIFICATION: --backup-email now reconciles msg-db
                        against the .eml files on disk (it never did); a shortfall is
                        classified first — messages in the sibling _quarantined/
                        folder are deliberate exclusions, and only a shortfall beyond
                        those is an error. A genuine shortfall in either backup path
                        is now a summary ERROR, so licence removal is held and the
                        Gmail access a re-download needs survives (was: warning, then
                        "Email migrated" + licences removed on top of a short backup).
                        DRIVE EXIT 56 ZERO MOVED: exit 56 with no per-file transfer
                        confirmations is no longer reported as benign skips — either
                        every item failed or the source owned nothing; the operator is
                        told to verify and licence removal is held.
                        RE-SUSPEND CRASH GUARD: the atexit re-suspend guard is now
                        registered even under --no-suspend; only a run that reaches
                        the suspension phase normally waives it. A crash or Ctrl+C
                        mid-run can no longer leave a previously-suspended account
                        silently active.
                        DISK-SPACE PREFLIGHT: before a GYB download, the mailbox size
                        (estimated from GAM's storage fields) is compared with free
                        space on the backup volume — larger than free aborts, over 80%
                        warns. A 100 GB mailbox no longer fills the disk overnight.
                        ONE DOWNLOAD, TWO PURPOSES: --backup-email plus an email
                        migration in the same run no longer downloads the mailbox
                        twice; the migration's retained backup serves as the archive.
                        DRIVE BACKUP RESUME: --backup-drive re-runs now offer to sync
                        into the newest prior backup folder (rclone only fetches
                        new/changed files), mirroring v5.4.0's mailbox resume,
                        same 30-day --force cap.
                        TERMINAL FAIL-FAST: a restore refused with a terminal
                        400-class error (failedPrecondition, invalid_grant, Mail
                        service not enabled) with nothing restored stops after
                        attempt 1 instead of burning stall-bail-out attempts,
                        each of which re-scanned the whole corpus for quarantine
                        (2026-08-03 dev-round lesson). Throttle markers still
                        retry with batch step-down as before.
  2026-08-03 - v5.4.0 - Admin-account gate (Gavin-X, PR #26 / issue #10): offboarding a user
                        who still holds Super Admin or delegated-admin roles now aborts
                        before any mutation with the exact gam commands to list and remove
                        the role assignments; --allow-admin-account is the deliberate
                        override, and --force does NOT imply it. Plus four field fixes from
                        a client production run and the 2026-08-03 dev round:
                        EMAIL DESTINATION MAILBOX: preflight now probes the email
                        destination's gmailprofile and aborts if Gmail is not enabled —
                        previously an unlicensed destination passed validation and the
                        restore failed with "Mail service not enabled" only AFTER the full
                        mailbox download (hours on a real leaver). The equivalent check in
                        check_restore_destination_ready() also fired only when gam exited 0,
                        but gam exits 73 for mailbox-less users; it now matches the output
                        text regardless of exit status. BACKUP RESUME: the mailbox backup
                        folder is date-stamped, so a re-run on a later day minted a fresh
                        folder and re-downloaded the entire mailbox; when a prior backup
                        folder exists the script now offers to resume into it (interactive
                        prompt showing its age; under --force it auto-resumes folders up
                        to 30 days old and starts fresh beyond that, since an older folder
                        is likely a previous engagement whose restore would resurrect
                        long-deleted mail).
                        DRIVE EXIT 56: gam's transfer drive exits 56 when files the source
                        could access but not own were skipped; that was reported as a hard
                        failure and blocked licence removal behind a transfer that lost
                        nothing (a week on one client ticket) — now a warning naming the count
                        moved, with a verify instruction. HONEST ATTEMPT COUNT: a restore
                        failure summary reported the 20-attempt ceiling even when the stall
                        bail-out stopped after 3; it now reports the attempts actually run.
  2026-07-29 - v5.3.0 - Three state-safety defects reported by Gavin-X (issues #2, #3, #5),
                        all in the same shape: the run ended in a state nobody could see.
                        SUSPENSION STATE: destinations are now validated BEFORE the temporary
                        unsuspend, so a preflight abort can no longer leave an account that
                        started suspended sitting active; the unsuspend itself is verified by
                        read-back (GAM has reported suspension updates that had not taken
                        effect) and an atexit guard re-suspends on every remaining exit path,
                        including an unhandled exception. --unsuspend with --no-suspend is now
                        refused at parse time: they ask for opposite end states.
                        FAILED TRANSFERS: a failed backup or transfer holds licence removal
                        back, because removing the licence kills the Gmail and Drive access the
                        retry needs. Suspension still runs — containment is not the thing worth
                        deferring. No override flag: a skip flag mixable into any combination
                        is a worse trap than the one it removes, and one gam command removes a
                        licence by hand once the data is confirmed safe.
                        CONTAINMENT: execute_kill_switch() returns what it actually achieved
                        instead of returning nothing. A failed password scramble or an
                        unconfirmed sign-out is now a summary ERROR, and it overrides
                        --no-suspend: an account that could not be locked is not left active.
                        Also removed run_shell_pipe(), dead since the alias rewrite and
                        carrying shell=True, and the unread originally_suspended.
  2026-07-28 - v5.2.0 - Restore hardening, from a full test round against a live dev tenant
                        using a 190GB real-world mailbox corpus. DESTINATION PRE-FLIGHT: a
                        restore into a SUSPENDED mailbox fails with a generic backendError that
                        is indistinguishable from rate limiting in the log — GYB backs off up
                        to 60s per attempt, 10 attempts per batch, then gives up quietly, so
                        the run can burn hours and report nothing useful. validate_destination
                        now matches the "Account Suspended: True" FIELD rather than any line
                        containing both words (a user surnamed "Suspended" was a false
                        positive) and fails the phase with an explanatory error. New
                        check_restore_destination_ready() also warns when the backup is larger
                        than the tenant's free POOLED storage, and when the backup contains
                        messages with no usable Date header — Gmail re-stamps those with the
                        restore date, so years-old mail arrives looking new (11 of 170,888 on
                        the migration this was found on; caused by the sender, not fixable in
                        GYB). CRASH-DIRECTED QUARANTINE: new quarantine_gyb_locked_file()
                        parses the .eml path out of GYB's own PermissionError traceback instead
                        of re-scanning the backup after a crash. AV locking is
                        non-deterministic, so a post-crash re-scan races the scanner and often
                        finds the poison file readable — observed live, where one such file
                        killed four consecutive retry attempts. The traceback names the culprit
                        exactly. A named file that reads cleanly now is deliberately LEFT in
                        place (transient block, not a quarantine). RETRY LOOP:
                        MAX_RESTORE_ATTEMPTS 5 -> 20 (poison files cluster; five was observed
                        to be too few), with an early bail-out after three consecutive attempts
                        that neither restore anything nor find anything to quarantine, so a
                        hard failure no longer burns the whole budget in silence. Progress is
                        now measured from GYB's resume DB rather than its stdout, which freezes
                        for long stretches in the tail phase of a large mailbox. THROTTLING
                        LADDER: on a throttling-shaped failure the restore steps its batch size
                        down 100 -> 75 -> 50 -> 25 -> 10, never below 10 (at --batch-size 1 GYB
                        switches to a path that never commits the resume DB mid-run, so a crash
                        at 99% restarts from message 1). An AV crash deliberately does NOT step
                        the ladder. REPORTING: run_gyb gains suppress_summary_error, mirroring
                        run_gam, so recovered intermediate attempts stay out of the end-of-run
                        summary — previously a run that succeeded on attempt 5 finished
                        reporting "Errors (4)" beside its success line and read as a failure.
                        DRIVE COMPLETENESS: rclone exits 0 on an incomplete backup, so
                        verify_drive_backup_complete() now reconciles GAM's file count against
                        the files on disk. Drive is not a filesystem — two files may share a
                        name in one folder, and when both export to the same extension the
                        second overwrites the first ("Untitled document" is the commonest
                        filename there). Forms and Sites cannot be exported at all and are not
                        even listed, and a file owned by the user but parented only in someone
                        else's folder is outside the tree rclone walks. The check names all
                        three causes and reports the leaver's TRASH separately, since rclone
                        does not fetch it and deleting the account destroys it. The comparison
                        queries "trashed = false" and reads GAM's own LAST "Got N" line: it
                        prints one per page, so the first is a page size, not a file count —
                        parsing it that way made a 106-file shortfall read as verified.
                        SHARED DRIVES: check_shared_drives() reports every drive the leaver
                        organizes and escalates the ones with no other organizer, which nothing
                        in an offboarding transfers or backs up. A membership read that FAILS
                        is reported as unknown rather than as proof of sole organizership.
                        SELF-TRANSFER: preflight_destinations() refuses a destination that
                        resolves to the leaver, including via one of their aliases. 2SV: the
                        enforced refusal (GAM exit 50, "required by admin policy") is now
                        recognised. It aborts nothing else in the deprovision bundle — tokens,
                        app passwords, backup codes, sign-out and POP/IMAP all complete — so
                        the run reports containment done and explains that removing the OU
                        policy, not retrying, is what changes the outcome. The plan no longer
                        predicts that refusal from the enforcement flag: enforcement follows
                        the OU and the kill switch moves the user first, so the prediction was
                        made against the OU being left.
  2026-07-22 - v5.1.0 - Configurable backup location + restore that survives AV-locked
                        messages. NEW --backup-dir PATH sets the root for all backup
                        artefacts (snapshots, mailbox, Drive); the BACKUP_DIRECTORY constant
                        can also be edited for a permanent default. Point it OUTSIDE a synced
                        folder (iCloud/Dropbox/Drive): a mailbox backup can be hundreds of GB
                        and a synced folder re-uploads all of it every run. RESTORE
                        AUTO-RECOVERY: endpoint AV can lock a malicious .eml at any moment,
                        non-deterministically (a file can read fine then raise PermissionError
                        moments later), killing GYB mid-restore; one clean pre-scan cannot
                        guarantee a clean restore. The restore now retries (up to 5x),
                        re-quarantining whatever is unreadable on each failure. This is safe
                        because GYB does not de-duplicate but Gmail's servers do — re-importing
                        the same message leaves one copy (GYB maintainer, discussion #446) — so
                        messages already restored before a crash collapse to a single copy on
                        the next pass. NEW --reuse-email-backup PATH restores from an existing
                        GYB backup folder and skips the download, running ONLY the email
                        restore (no containment / transfers / suspension) — use it to resume a
                        restore that died partway without re-downloading a large mailbox. The
                        real root-cause fix remains an on-access-scan exclusion for the backup
                        folder in the endpoint AV policy. RESTORE SPEED + RESUME: the restore
                        now passes --batch-size (default 50, --restore-batch-size to override).
                        GYB defaults restore batch_size to 1, which uploads every message as
                        its own request (serial, days for a large mailbox) AND only commits the
                        resume DB at the end of the run, so any crash restarts from message 1.
                        Batching messages <=1MB makes the restore many times faster and commits
                        the resume DB per batch, so a crash resumes instead of restarting
                        (verified against gyb.py restore source, lines ~2333/2399/2446).
  2026-07-13 - v5.0.0 - Reporting/verification hardening (11 findings, all fixed and
                        regression-tested; every phase live-verified on a dev tenant, with a
                        permanent offline unit-test suite in test_offboard_user.py).
                        BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: --force no longer implies --unsuspend (see below).
                        Failed GAM commands are no longer reported as completed actions:
                        suspend_user, delete_user, kill-switch steps 2/4/6/7 (recovery-info
                        wipe, signout, password scramble, GAL hide), transfer_calendar and
                        set_auto_reply now check the command result before recording success
                        (same bug class as the v4.7.0 migrate_email fix, applied to all
                        remaining callers). Forwarding-address verification now matches the
                        'accepted' status on the target address's own output line, so an
                        unrelated already-accepted forwarding address can no longer
                        false-positive the check; poll failures no longer add one summary
                        error per attempt. --force no longer implies --unsuspend: an
                        already-suspended user is only temporarily unsuspended when the
                        explicit --unsuspend flag is given (interactive prompt unchanged
                        without --force). Fixed pre-logging crash when stdin is closed at
                        the initial user prompt (clean exit 2 instead of a traceback).
                        Licence labels no longer whitespace-split multi-word display names
                        ("Cloud Identity" was rendered as "Cloud (skuId)"); with multiple
                        licences the labels fall back to skuIds. Dry runs no longer create
                        backup directories. Snapshot embeds SCRIPT_VERSION instead of a
                        hardcoded version string. ALIAS DATA-LOSS FIX (found live on the
                        dev tenant): the alias transfer previously piped `gam print aliases`
                        into `gam csv - gam update alias ~Alias user <dest>`; GAM's update
                        alias is delete-then-insert and the insert can race Directory API
                        propagation, failing with "Duplicate" and destroying the alias,
                        while `gam csv` swallows the failure so the run reported success.
                        Aliases are now transferred one-by-one (delete, then create on the
                        destination with retry while the deletion propagates) and reported
                        per alias; any alias that cannot be recreated is a loud error with
                        the manual recovery command. Deprovision drops the popimap token
                        for mailbox-less users (Cloud Identity / Gmail-off), whose POP/IMAP
                        toggle otherwise fails the whole deprovision with exit 73. Suspension
                        is verified by read-back: GAM's 'Updated' response was observed
                        (live, dev tenant) reporting success for a suspension-state change
                        that did not take effect, so the final suspend now re-reads the
                        account state (with retries) and raises a critical error if the
                        account still reads active. Kill-switch step 5 is verify-first:
                        after deprovision already carried turnoff2sv, the explicit
                        turnoff2sv only fires if 2SV still reads enrolled (re-firing on an
                        unenrolled user produced an exit-50 false error in successful
                        runs). The dependency check's 'gam info domain' probe no longer
                        leaks transient failures into the end-of-run error list.
  2026-07-07 - v4.7.0 - Email migration hardened against AV-quarantined messages: a malicious email in the source mailbox can be quarantined on local disk by endpoint antivirus after GYB writes it during backup, and GYB's restore crashes on the unreadable file. A pre-restore scan now probes every backed-up .eml and moves unreadable ones to a sibling <backup>_quarantined/ folder so GYB's own missing-file handling skips them; skipped messages are listed (Gmail message ID + date) in <backup>_skipped-messages.csv next to the backup and flagged in the run summary. Also fixed the restore result being ignored: a failed restore now reports an error with the retained backup path instead of logging "Email migrated".

Planned Features (not yet implemented)
  - Batch processing via CSV file: accept a list of users (e.g. --csv users.csv)
    and iterate the full offboarding flow per row, with per-user logs and a
    consolidated run summary.
  - --manager shortcut flag: auto-resolve the departing user's manager (from
    the directory) as the default --all-transfer-to destination, so common
    cases do not need an explicit address.
  - --wipe-devices flag: opt-in automatic mobile account_wipe and ChromeOS
    deprovision_retiring_device actions, instead of only listing devices and
    printing manual guidance.
  - YAML configuration file support: load defaults (GAM/GYB/rclone paths,
    OFFBOARDING_OU, BACKUP_DIR, default flags) from a config.yaml so the
    CONFIGURATION constants do not need to be edited in-script.
  - JSON output mode (--json): emit a machine-readable run summary (per-phase
    status, counts, errors, paths to artefacts) for automation pipelines, in
    addition to the existing human-readable summary.
  - Dedicated signature backup: write the user's sendas/signature HTML to a
    standalone file in the backup directory (today it is only captured as a
    field inside the pre-flight JSON snapshot).

    it stays False on licensed, provably restorable mailboxes. A brand-new
    unlicensed destination therefore slips this preflight; it is still
    caught by the same check re-run at restore time, after the download,

      6. Scramble password (blocks login even if above steps partially fail)
      7. Hide from GAL (cosmetic but important for clean directory)

    EDGE CASE: If user is already suspended, deprovision backup codes

    Move unreadable .eml files out of the GYB backup folder so the restore
    skips them instead of crashing, and write a skipped-messages CSV.

    Why: endpoint antivirus can quarantine a message file in place right
    after GYB writes it during backup (a genuinely malicious email that was
    sitting in the source mailbox). The file still exists on disk but every
    read raises PermissionError, and GYB's restore has no per-message
    read-error handling, so one locked file kills the whole restore mid-run.
    GYB DOES skip a file that is absent (its own os.path.isfile() check), so
    the portable fix is to make the bad file absent: probe each .eml with a
    one-byte read and move any unreadable one to a sibling
    <backup>_quarantined/ folder, outside --local-folder. Moving works even
    while reading is blocked, because a rename is a directory metadata
    operation, not a file read. Nothing is deleted.

    Each skipped file is reported by its basename, which is the Gmail
    immutable message ID: admins can look the message up in their AV
    quarantine log, Google Vault, or the Security Investigation Tool. The
    message date is pulled from GYB's msg-db.sqlite (read-only) when
    available. A CSV of skipped messages is written next to the backup
    folder.

    Never raises: any unexpected condition degrades to a loud warning so the
    pre-scan can slow a run down but cannot break one. Side benefit: reading
    every file here provokes on-access AV to flag bad files BEFORE the
    restore starts rather than partway through it.
