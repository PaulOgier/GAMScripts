Credit: after six months of using this script to audit our own clients, Dirk
Grobler's request for help with his tenant-scoping batch script on the
google-apps-manager group inspired us to publish it for the community
(https://groups.google.com/g/google-apps-manager/c/9r_AeuiWOSg).

The tenant-settings checks against the CISA SCuBA Google Workspace baselines
use CISA's ScubaGoggles (https://github.com/cisagov/ScubaGoggles, public
domain) as a guide: its rules for what passes, and its reading of Google's
documented policy defaults. The checks themselves are this script's own and
run on the data GAM collects.

Created:      2026-08-15
Updated:      2026-10-07
Version:      1.7.0
Status:       Production
Python:       3.9+
Dependencies: GAM ADV X (GAM7) only. Stdlib only on the Python side.

What it does
------------
A READ-ONLY Google Workspace tenant audit. Three stages, each restartable:

  collect -> check -> render

  collect : runs a registry of GAM7 print/report commands, each writing one
            CSV into a timestamped run directory. manifest.json records
            completed modules so a re-run resumes instead of restarting.
  check   : a findings engine reads ONLY the collected CSVs and produces
            findings (severity, plain-English title, what it means,
            remediation, evidence rows).
  render  : a single self-contained HTML report (print stylesheet -> clean
            PDF), compared with the previous completed run of the same
            customer, and an internal qa_report.html that says whether the
            report is ready to send. Preflight results and any modules that
            could not run are always listed - nothing is silently absent.

Safety posture
--------------
Every GAM command issued is a read (print / report / info / oauth info /
check serviceaccount). GAM's filelist cannot use admin access, so a
non-member scan silently returns zero rows; each Shared Drive is therefore
listed as one of its own active members, and nobody's access changes. ONE
opt-in exception: --grant-temp-access, for a drive no member can list,
temporarily adds the auditing admin as organizer, scans, then removes that
access again. Off by default; without it those drives are reported as
UNSCANNED.

Module tiers
------------
  1  tenant-level, cheap (domains, users, groups, admins, shared drive
     metadata, devices, policies, tokens, Vault, reports, the last
     30 days of admin log, risky sign-ins and Alert Center alerts, and
     Classroom courses, rosters, invitations and guardians on Education
     tenants)
  2  per-user Gmail/Calendar settings via domain-wide delegation
     (send-as, delegates, forwarding, filters, IMAP/POP, ASPs,
     backup-code counts, calendar ACLs)
  3  heavy Drive scans, skippable (external sharing outbound and inbound,
     Shared Drive external exposure, Sites inventory)
  4  off by default, enabled with --full (vacation, browsers,
     context-aware access levels, mailbox profiles, file counts)
  DNS  per-domain MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC via the tamingdns.com MCP endpoint,
     with a dns.google fallback when it is unreachable

Example usage:
  python tenant_scope.py --list                      # show the module registry
  python tenant_scope.py --admin admin@example.com   # full default audit
  python tenant_scope.py --admin admin@example.com --only users,groups,dns
  python tenant_scope.py --admin admin@example.com --skip-tier 3
  python tenant_scope.py --admin admin@example.com --run-dir <dir>  # resume
  python tenant_scope.py --admin admin@example.com --full --grant-temp-access
  python tenant_scope.py --render-only --run-dir <dir>  # re-render, no GAM
  python tenant_scope.py --tenant clienta --admin admin@clienta.example
  python tenant_scope.py --all --yes --no-open       # every tenant in tenants.json

Exit codes: 0 complete; 1 preflight failed or wrong tenant; 2 complete but
some modules could not run; 130 interrupted. --all returns the worst, in that order of priority.

Notes that matter when reading results:
  - "all users" in GAM iterates ACTIVE users only. By default this audit does
    the same and says so in the report; --include-suspended adds suspended
    users to the per-user modules.
  - Backup verification codes are LIVE codes. The collector keeps only the
    count; the codes themselves are never written to disk.
  - Spam/Trash, suspended-user mail settings and 2-day report lag are stated
    in the report where they apply.

Changelog
  2026-10-07 - v1.7.0 - New findings: files made public or shared outside
                        in the last 30 days (Drive audit log), domain-wide
                        delegation granted in the last 30 days, Gmail
                        filters matching business-email-compromise
                        patterns, super admins without a phishing-resistant
                        second factor, files shared with target audiences,
                        and settings below the CISA SCuBA Google Workspace
                        baseline (each row cites its requirement). Settings
                        the Policy API omits are judged at Google's
                        documented default (policy_defaults.json). Each run
                        is compared with the last completed run of the same
                        customer (resolved, new, rows new this month), with
                        a posture score and six-run trend; a finding whose
                        data was incomplete in either run is not compared,
                        never resolved, and a module that ran in neither run
                        is left out. --tenants/--tenant/--all with a
                        customer-ID hard stop and break-glass accounts;
                        qa_report.html delivery gate; exit codes 0/1/2/130,
                        with not-applicable modules (Classroom without an
                        Education licence) not counted. Shared Drive scan
                        reads ACLs only for items shared beyond the drive's
                        members. Gmail filters run by default. Log lines
                        carry one tag.
  2026-10-02 - v1.6.2 - Shared Drives are listed as one of their own
                        active members (organizers first), so no grant is
                        needed and an unlicensed audit admin works;
                        --grant-temp-access is only the fallback for a
                        drive no member can list, and a refused grant
                        reports Google's reason. Any resume re-runs drives
                        left UNSCANNED. My Drive scan limit 1h -> 4h.
                        Admin app passwords are HIGH, not CRITICAL: they
                        cannot sign in to the Admin console, only to
                        mail, calendar and contacts apps. Target audiences
                        are no longer reported as external domain shares.
  2026-10-01 - v1.6.1 - Classroom, after the first run on an Education
                        tenant: rosters, class invitations and guardians
                        are collected; classes with outside members or
                        invitations are HIGH, classes owned by a deleted
                        or suspended account MEDIUM, and letting
                        self-declared (pending) teachers create classes
                        MEDIUM; guardians and pending guardian invitations
                        are listed with their age. Course owners are read.
                        GAM's progress lines ahead of the invitations CSV
                        are stripped so the file parses. Classroom's own
                        classroom_teachers group is no longer reported as
                        ownerless. 225 tests.
  2026-10-01 - v1.6.0 - Four new checks from the collected policies: super
                        admin self-recovery on, Gmail Safety protections off
                        (per switch, per OU), Chat spaces open to every
                        outside domain, and a list of checklist settings no
                        API exposes so the report never implies they were
                        checked. Also from policies: alert rules switched
                        off, Takeout per service, Drive for desktop on any
                        device, Meet safety, mail delegation, third-party
                        app access (raw), and the security features the
                        tenant's edition includes but does not use (DLP,
                        Context-Aware Access, trust rules, security center,
                        advanced mobile management), silent on editions
                        without them. New default reads: 30 days of admin
                        log, risky sign-in events and Alert Center alerts
                        (alerts moved out of --full). Preflight waits 300s for `info domain` and
                        accepts a non-zero exit that still printed the
                        tenant identity (seen on a tenant created that day).
                        Same day, from an audit of the audit: the report
                        lists every check that ran and found nothing, and
                        findings_evidence.csv carries every evidence row;
                        data collected since 1.0.0 but read by nothing now
                        has checks (send-as, forwarding addresses on file,
                        group members and owners, vacation, Vault exports,
                        Google-suspended accounts, new accounts, recovery
                        phones, 2SV enforcement on admins, root-OU users,
                        per-drive copy controls, app inventory, weak
                        passwords and second factors from the usage
                        report); SPF, DKIM and MX get findings beside
                        DMARC; read-only Gmail and Drive scopes count as
                        risky; five more hand-check rows (domain-wide
                        delegation first); Classroom settings and courses
                        on Education tenants. gmailprofile and filecounts
                        moved to --full. After a live run on a
                        Business Standard tenant: Google's blocked
                        sensitive actions get their own MEDIUM finding
                        (with the action named) instead of counting as
                        HIGH risky sign-ins, and a missing recovery email
                        no longer counts as an at-risk factor. 215 tests.
  2026-09-30 - v1.5.1 - Repository folder renamed from "Tenant Scoping
                        Audit" to google-workspace-security-audit; the
                        startup update check now reads VERSION from the new
                        path. A VERSION copy stays at the old path so
                        earlier releases keep checking. No functional
                        change.
  2026-09-01 - v1.5.0 - Tenant-level modules collect four at a time; the
                        tier-3 Drive sweeps and calendar ACLs run as one GAM
                        batch per module instead of one process per user;
                        DNS domains are checked in parallel. A timeout now
                        kills GAM's batch children too, and Ctrl+C lets the
                        running module finish (exit 130). Fixes: the
                        external-forwarding check read a column GAM7 does
                        not emit and could never fire; licence waste fired
                        on every SKU when the licenses module had not run,
                        and summed archived-user seats into the parent SKU;
                        a selection filter that left nobody widened the scan
                        to every mailbox; --render-only without --run-dir
                        rendered an empty "clean" report; the log file
                        carried ANSI codes; a resumed run kept a DNS
                        fallback decided by a blip. App-password check now
                        covers delegated admins; archived accounts no longer
                        count as unenrolled or dormant. Load-tested on a
                        130k-file tenant: 5m51s, no rate-limit retries.
                        148 tests.
  2026-08-15 - v1.3.7 - First public release. Everything from the internal
                        1.x line: external-share findings (named users,
                        whole domains, inbound), people-centric checks
                        (dormancy tiers, mailbox delegation, at-risk
                        composite, offboarding debt), policy checks from
                        the Policy API (password, session length, per-OU
                        2SV, shared-drive defaults, per-service on/off),
                        licence waste, admin-role hygiene. 104 unit tests.
  2026-08-15 - v1.0.0 - Initial release: preflight gates, module registry
                        (tiers 1-4 + DNS), manifest-based resume, findings
                        engine, self-contained HTML report.

    stripped.

    The Policy API returns every policy that could apply to a target, not
    the one that wins: Google's own defaults (type SYSTEM) sit alongside
    what the administrator set (type ADMIN), plus a licence-scoped copy per
    SKU. A tenant whose admin raised the password minimum still shows the
    SYSTEM default of 8 in its own row, so reading the rows as-is reports a
    weak policy that is not in force.

    Google resolves them with the Max/Merge reducer: for each field, the
    value from the policy with the greatest policyQuery.sortOrder wins
    (docs.cloud.google.com/identity/docs/concepts/policy-api-concepts).
    Admin policies carry a higher sortOrder than system ones (measured on
    a test tenant: an admin-set security.password at 201.00332 against
    three system rows at 101.000x), so merging the values of a
    (setting, OU) group in ascending sortOrder yields the setting actually
    in force.

    Licence filtering is not modelled - a policy scoped to one
    SKU is treated as applying to the whole OU. Where two SKUs in the same
    OU genuinely differ, the higher sortOrder wins and the divergence is
