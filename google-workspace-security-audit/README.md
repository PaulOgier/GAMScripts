# Google Workspace Security Audit Script for GAM7 (Tenant Scoping Audit)

A free, open-source, **read-only Google Workspace security audit** in a single
Python file. `tenant_scope.py` collects tenant configuration and
security-posture data through [GAM7](https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM), runs a
findings engine over it, and renders a self-contained HTML report your client
(or your manager) can actually read: what was found, why it matters, what to do.

Use it to audit a Google Workspace tenant on day one of a new client, to
baseline a security uplift, to scope a Google Workspace migration or domain
move, or to produce the security section of an acquisition due-diligence pack.

## Who this is for

- **Google Workspace administrators** who want a security review of their own
  tenant without clicking through every Admin console screen.
- **Managed service providers (MSPs) and IT consultants** who inherit tenants
  built by other people and need to know what is about to bite.
- **Security and compliance teams** who need evidence, not a screenshot: every
  finding traces back to a CSV of raw data.
- **Buyers and advisers** who need a Google Workspace security assessment as
  part of due diligence before an acquisition.

## Why this exists

We run IT for other companies, which means we regularly inherit Google
Workspace tenants that other people built. The same three situations kept
sending us into the Admin console with a checklist and a bad feeling:

- **A new client signs.** Day one, we need to know what is about to bite:
  which files are public on the web, whose mail quietly forwards off-domain,
  which admin left in 2019 but still holds the keys.
- **A client is preparing for something big**: a migration, a domain move, a
  security uplift. Before you change anything, you need an honest picture of
  what is there now.
- **A client is being acquired.** The buyer wants to know where the security
  gaps are before they sign, and "we clicked around the console for a day"
  is not an answer you can put in a due-diligence pack.

Clicking through the Admin console for that takes a day per tenant and still
misses things, because the console shows you settings one screen at a time
and never volunteers what you forgot to look at. This script pulls the data
in one pass, applies the checks we kept re-deriving by hand, and writes down
both the findings and the list of things it could not check.

Credit where it is due: we had been using this script on our own clients for
about six months when Dirk Grobler asked for help with his tenant-scoping
batch script on the
[google-apps-manager group](https://groups.google.com/g/google-apps-manager/c/9r_AeuiWOSg).
That question inspired us to open ours up to the Google admin community.
Thank you, Dirk.

### Tenant inventory and Vault

- The tenant at a glance: users, licences, groups, Shared Drives, mobile and
  ChromeOS devices, Vault, SSO [Info]
- Vault exports on record [Info]

Anything that could not be checked (missing authorisation, module error,
unscanned drives) is listed in the report, and so is every check that ran
over real data and found nothing ("Checked and clean"). Absence of a finding
never means "checked and clean" unless the check appears in that list.
`findings_evidence.csv` carries every evidence row of every finding, so two
runs can be diffed by who was named, not just by counts.

## What you get

- `audit_report.html`: a single self-contained HTML file (no external
  assets), severity tiles up top, one section per finding with plain-English
  "what this means" and "what to do" copy, and evidence samples. Print it for
  a clean PDF.
- `findings.csv`: the findings list in machine-readable form.
- `findings_evidence.csv`: every evidence row of every finding.
- One CSV per collected module, so every finding can be traced back to raw
  data.
- `tenant_scope.log` + `gam_stderr.log`: the full audit trail.

## Safety posture: read-only by design

Every GAM command the script issues is a read (`print`, `report`, `info`,
`oauth info`, `check serviceaccount`), with one opt-in exception:
`--grant-temp-access`. GAM's `filelist` has no admin-access mode, so a
non-member scan silently returns zero rows and the drive would look clean.
Each Shared Drive is therefore listed as one of its own active members,
organizers first, and nobody's access changes. Only a drive that no member
can list (none active, or none with a Drive licence) needs the flag, which
adds the auditing admin as organizer, scans, and removes the grant again; by
default those drives are reported **UNSCANNED** instead.

Backup verification codes never reach disk. The collector keeps only the
per-user count.

It is safe to run against a production tenant. Nothing is changed, suspended,
deleted or transferred.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (standard library only, no packages to install)
- GAM7 (GAM ADV X) installed and authorised against the tenant you are
  auditing. The script finds it on PATH, at `~/bin/gam7/gam` (macOS
  installer), or `C:\GAM7\gam.exe` (Windows).
- Works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Install

Clone the repository, or download `tenant_scope.py` on its own; it has no
dependencies beyond Python and GAM7.

```
git clone https://github.com/PaulOgier/GAMScripts.git
cd GAMScripts/google-workspace-security-audit
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com
```

## Usage

```
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com
```

That is the whole thing: tiers 1 to 3 plus the DNS checks, into a new
timestamped run directory, with the report opened at the end.

### Every flag

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--admin <email>` | The auditing admin. Verifies the service account's DWD scopes in the preflight, and is the account the Shared Drive scans run as. Without it those scans are skipped and per-user modules run unverified. |
| `--list` | Print the module registry (key, title, tier) and exit. |
| `--full` | Add the tier-4 modules: Gmail filters, vacation responders, managed browsers, context-aware access, Gmail profile sizes and Drive file counts. |
| `--only <keys>` | Comma-separated module keys; everything else is skipped. |
| `--skip <keys>` | Comma-separated module keys to skip. |
| `--skip-tier <n>` | Skip a whole tier, e.g. `--skip-tier 3` to leave out the heavy Drive scans. |
| `--no-dns` | Skip the DNS checks. |
| `--include-suspended` | Include suspended accounts in the per-user scans. Default is active accounts only, and the report says which. |
| `--skip-never-logged-in` | Exclude accounts that have never signed in from the per-user scans. |
| `--grant-temp-access` | The one write in the script. Needs `--admin`. See below. |
| `--output-dir <dir>` | Where run directories are created. Default `./tenant_audit_runs/`. |
| `--run-dir <dir>` | Resume an existing run. Completed modules are skipped. |
| `--render-only` | Re-run the checks and rebuild the report from a `--run-dir` (required), with no GAM calls at all. |
| `--dry-run` | Print every GAM command without executing it. The preflight still runs `gam version` and `gam info domain`; only `--render-only` makes no GAM call at all. |
| `--no-open` | Don't open the report in a browser when the run finishes. |
| `--yes` | Skip the interactive tenant confirmation. The identity is still logged. |

### Worked examples

```
python3 tenant_scope.py --list
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --full
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --skip-tier 3
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --only users,groups,dns
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --run-dir <dir>
python3 tenant_scope.py --render-only --run-dir <dir>
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --dry-run
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --grant-temp-access
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --skip-never-logged-in --no-open --yes
```

**Overnight on a large tenant.** `--skip-tier 3` first for the quick picture,
then the same run directory again without the skip so only the Drive scans
execute:

```
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --skip-tier 3
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --run-dir tenant_audit_runs/tenant_audit_<stamp>
```

**Re-render after a fix.** If a check itself was wrong, you do not need to
collect anything again:

```
python3 tenant_scope.py --render-only --run-dir tenant_audit_runs/tenant_audit_<stamp>
```

**Scheduled or headless.** `--yes` answers the tenant prompt, `--no-open`
leaves the browser alone:

```
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --yes --no-open
```

**A tenant full of accounts nobody has ever used.** `--skip-never-logged-in`
drops them from the per-user scans, and the report states how many were
excluded. It is off by default because an admin-set forward on an account
nobody has ever signed into is exactly the thing an audit should find:

```
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --skip-never-logged-in
```

**Shared Drives.** `filelist` has no admin-access mode, so a non-member scan
returns zero rows and looks clean. Each drive is listed as one of its own active
members instead (the `shareddrive.scannedAs` column says who), which works even
when the auditing admin has no Workspace licence. A member sees what membership
shows them, so a limited-access folder they are kept out of is not covered.
A drive no member can list is reported UNSCANNED unless you pass
`--grant-temp-access`, which adds the auditing admin as organizer, scans, and
removes the grant again:

```
python3 tenant_scope.py --admin admin@yourdomain.com --grant-temp-access --only shareddrive_external
```

### How a run behaves

The preflight confirms the tenant (primary domain + customer ID) with you
before anything is collected, because auditing the wrong tenant is the worst
silent failure this kind of tool can have. `--yes` skips the prompt but still logs
the identity.

Collection runs in three passes. The domain and user lists go first because
everything else depends on them. The tenant-level prints (OUs, groups, admins,
devices, policies, reports, DNS) then run four at a time, since each is one
short GAM process and the long ones (`report users`, `tokens`) hide the rest.
The per-mailbox modules and the Drive scans run one at a time: each already
forks up to 20 GAM processes as a batch over an explicit list of the accounts
being audited, and the tier-3 Drive sweeps use the same batch instead of one
GAM process per user.

Each per-mailbox batch runs up to 20 GAM workers (`SCAN_THREADS`), which want
about 4 GB of free memory. On a 130,000-file test tenant a full run took 5m51s
on a 4 GB machine and 10m49s on a 3 GB one, with no API rate-limit retries on
either; memory is the ceiling, not Google's quota. Set `SCAN_THREADS` to 10 on
a small box.

Timeouts scale with the size of the tenant. GAM's own progress counters are
echoed to the console every 30 seconds during a long scan, so a Drive
enumeration that runs for hours doesn't look like a hang. If a command is
killed by its timeout, GAM and its batch children are all stopped, the rows
collected up to that point are kept, and the module is marked partial rather
than discarded.

Ctrl+C lets the module that is running finish (GAM runs in its own process
group, so the interrupt reaches the script and not GAM), then stops. The
report is still rendered over what was collected and the exit code is 130, so
a scheduled run can tell "complete" from "stopped". A second Ctrl+C kills
everything.

Each run writes into its own timestamped directory under
`./tenant_audit_runs/` (change with `--output-dir`). Runs are resumable:
`manifest.json` records completed modules, and `--run-dir` picks up where a
run stopped. A module marked partial because some mailboxes could not be read
(Gmail off, for instance) is not re-run on resume, since it would only end
partial again; one cut short by a timeout is.

A default run on a small tenant takes a few minutes. The tier-3 Drive scans
are the expensive part on large tenants; run them overnight, or start with
`--skip-tier 3` and fill in the blanks later: run again with
`--run-dir <that dir>` and no skip flag, and only the missing modules
execute before the report re-renders over the complete data set.

### Reading the report

A finding looks like this in the HTML:

> **[CRITICAL] Mailboxes forwarding to addresses outside the organisation**
>
> *What this means:* All mail arriving in these mailboxes is being copied or
> moved to an external address. This is a common way company data quietly
> leaves the organisation, and one of the first things attackers set up
> after compromising an account.
>
> *What to do:* Confirm with each user whether the forward is legitimate
> business use. Remove any that are not, and review the account's recent
> sign-in activity if the forward was not set up knowingly.

Evidence tables show a sample (10 rows by default) with the true total in
the headline; the full list is always in the module's CSV next to the
report.

### DNS checks

Per domain, MX/SPF/DKIM/DMARC are checked through
[tamingdns.com](https://tamingdns.com). If it is unreachable, the module
falls back to dns.google with presence-only checks, and the report says
which path ran.

### Things the report states rather than hides

- GAM's `all users` iterates ACTIVE users only. Per-user checks cover active
  users unless you pass `--include-suspended`; the report says which.
- Usage-report figures (storage) lag roughly two days behind live state.
- Shared Drives the auditing admin cannot scan are listed as UNSCANNED.
- Policy checks report the *resolved* setting. The Policy API returns
  Google's defaults, the administrator's own policy and a copy per
  licence SKU for the same org unit; the highest `sortOrder` wins, per
  Google's Max reducer. Licence scoping is not modelled, so a setting
  that genuinely differs between two SKUs in one org unit shows only the
  winner.

## How it compares to other Google Workspace audit tools

- **The Admin console security checklist and Security Center.** Google's own
  tools show one setting at a time and never tell you what you did not look
  at. This script checks the whole tenant in one pass and lists what it could
  not check.
- **Google Workspace security audit checklists** (the blog-post kind). Those
  tell you what to look for. This script looks, and writes the report.
- **Commercial auditing platforms** such as GAT Labs. Those are subscription
  products with continuous monitoring and remediation. This is a free,
  point-in-time audit you run yourself, with the raw CSVs next to the report.
- **Sheets-based checklists driven by the Admin SDK**, such as DoiT
  AdminPulse. Similar goals; this one runs locally through GAM7 you already
  have, adds Drive and Shared Drive sharing scans, Gmail forwarding and
  delegation, licence waste and DNS, and renders a client-ready HTML report.
- **Drive-only sharing audit scripts**. External file sharing is one section
  of this report, alongside admins, 2SV, Gmail, Groups, licences, OAuth apps
  and DNS.

## Frequently asked questions

**Is it safe to run against a live production tenant?**
Yes. Every command is a read. The only write, `--grant-temp-access`, is off
by default, is only used on a drive none of its members can list, and removes
its own grant when the scan finishes.

**Does it work with GAMADV-XTD3?**
It is built and tested against GAM7 (GAM ADV X), the successor to
GAMADV-XTD3, and looks for the `gam7` binary. If you are still on
GAMADV-XTD3, upgrade first; the [GAM7 Update](../gam7-update/) wrapper in
this repository does that safely on macOS and Linux.

**Do I need a service account with domain-wide delegation?**
For the tenant-level modules, no. The per-mailbox modules (forwarding,
delegates, IMAP/POP, send-as) and the Drive scans do need domain-wide
delegation, which is the standard GAM7 setup. The preflight tells you which
scopes are missing, and the report lists any module that could not run.

**Can I use it before a Google Workspace to Google Workspace migration?**
That is one of the reasons it exists. Run it on the source tenant to
inventory users, licences, groups, Shared Drives, external sharing and
forwarding before you move anything, and again on the target tenant when the
migration is done.

**How long does a Google Workspace audit take with this script?**
A few minutes on a small tenant. On large tenants the Drive sharing scans are
the slow part; run them overnight with `--run-dir` resume, or skip tier 3 for
a quick first picture.

**Does it fix anything?**
No. It reports. Fixing is a decision for a human with context, and the "what
to do" copy in each finding is written for that human.

**Which GAM commands does it run?**
`--dry-run` prints every GAM command without executing it, so you can review
the whole list before the first real run.
